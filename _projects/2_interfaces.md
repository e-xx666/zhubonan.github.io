# Interface structure prediction

Emerging properties may arise from unexpected atomic and electronic configurations at heterogeneous interfaces {% cite li_interface_2020 zhu_determining_2019 li_atomic-scale_2020 li_emergent_2023 %}.
A few examples include 2D electron gas, enhanced ferroelectric/ferromagnetic properties, interface mitigated fast ionic conductions.
