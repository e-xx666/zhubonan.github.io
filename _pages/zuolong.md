My name is Zuolong Jia and I joined the group as a master student in 2023. I am passionate about watching movies, cycling, and listening to music. I am also an enthusiastic learner, always eager to embrace new knowledge and expand my horizons. I believe that staying curious and open to new experiences helps me grow both personally and professionally. I'm excited to connect with others who share similar interests and to explore new opportunities for learning and development.
I am Xie Xiao, and I am honored to join Professor Zhu's research team. Professor Zhu is knowledgeable and friendly, and the team has a harmonious atmosphere with excellent research conditions. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at Beijing Institute of Technology (starting in 2024), with a strong interest in the computational design, physical properties, and applications of advanced materials. I enjoy outdoor sports and believe that connecting with nature is a wonderful experience. If you are interested in me, don't be shy. You can reach me at xx_bit@163.com.
