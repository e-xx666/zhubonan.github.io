I teach the following courses:

1. **Introduction and application of atomistic simulation techniques**: A gentle introduction to basic concepts of materials modelling with an emphasis on interactive practicals using JupyterHub. Topics covered includes Lennard-Jones potential, force fields and density functional theory and material discovery.

2. **Measurement techniques for nano-micro scales**: An introduction to various technologies of accessing material information at nano-micro scale. Topics covered include scanning probe microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electron microscopy.
