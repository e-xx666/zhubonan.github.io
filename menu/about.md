I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University College London, Department of Chemistry.
Started as an experimental physicist in my undergraduate study, I have gradually shifted into computational materials science/chemistry over the years.

## Current research interests

The cathode is a performance critical component for Li-ion batteries current powering most small electronic devices and will be used more widely in transportation vechile in the future. 
I am mainly interested predictive modelling and materials design for Li-ion cathode materials using first-principles method. 
One of the main area of my research is to use first-principles structure prediction methods to computational search for possible new cathode materials that are
performant, greener and more sustainable. 
Beside that, I also work on understanding the mechanisms affecting the performance in known cathode materials and the role of dopants.

### PhD research - interfaces thin film oxides 

Epitaxial oxide thin films are ideal platform for accessing novel physical phenomena as well as building practical functional devices.
Compared to bulk materials, the low dimensionality of thin films means that the interfaces play important roles in controlling the macroscopic properties,
an various unexpected properties can be induced.
One seminal example of this is the observation of two-dimensional electron gas at the LAO-STO interfaces, where both sides are in fact insulating oxides.
